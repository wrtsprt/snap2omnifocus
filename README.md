# snap2omnifocus

Sometimes taking one picture is the easiest way to add a task to my Omnifocus database. Often it's when I don't have much time but important information in front of me that I don't want to miss. I have tried sveral ways to make this quick, but it all takes too many taps.

When you open the app it lets you take a picture (with the default iOS ImagePicker), if you confirm the picture it'll open Omnifocus using hte URL scheme (https://inside.omnifocus.com/url-schemes) and add a task.
