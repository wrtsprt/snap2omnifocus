# snap2omnifocus

Sometimes taking one picture is the easiest way to add a task to my Omnifocus database. Often it's when I don't have much time but important information in front of me that I don't want to miss. I have tried several ways to make this quick, but it all takes too many taps.

When you open the app it lets you take a picture (with the default iOS ImagePicker), if you confirm the picture it'll open Omnifocus using hte URL scheme (https://inside.omnifocus.com/url-schemes) and add a task. 

## Things I've tried before 

* use Omnifocus itself (minimum 10 taps - if task gets one letter for name) 
* Siri Shortcuts - reduces amount of taps, but takes longer b/c of starting the app 
* IFTTT camera widget - takes long to open, number of taps OK
